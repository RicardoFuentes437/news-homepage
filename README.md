## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Material UI
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this challenge i learned how to make a drawer, i've never worked with them before so it was really interesting to investigate how to make one and the different ways it can be shown on a page or app.

### Continued development

I would like to work ore with drawers, for this challenge i made a basic one, but there are a lot of tools that i didn't get to use, so in the future i would like to create more complex drawers.

### Useful resources

- [MUI Drawer](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/) - This is the official MUI documentation, in this part it talks about Srawers and how to create them.
